# Soil Moisture Sensor

#### Project Overview

The Soil Moisture Sensor project illustrates how to use an Arduino Nano to measure the moisture level of soil using a soil moisture sensor. This project helps in monitoring soil moisture levels, which is crucial for efficient irrigation and plant health in agriculture and gardening applications.

#### Components Needed

1. **Arduino Nano**
2. **Soil Moisture Sensor**
3. **Jumper Wires**

#### Block Diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect Soil Moisture Sensor to Arduino Nano:**
   - Connect the VCC pin of the soil moisture sensor to the 5V pin on the Arduino Nano.
   - Connect the GND pin of the soil moisture sensor to the GND pin on the Arduino Nano.
   - Connect the A0 pin of the soil moisture sensor to analog pin A0 on the Arduino Nano.

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Wire the soil moisture sensor to the Arduino Nano as described in the circuit setup section.

2. **Code Upload:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE and paste the provided code.
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Nano.

3. **Testing:**
   - Once the code is uploaded, open the serial monitor.
   - The serial monitor will display the soil moisture level in percentage and indicate whether the soil is wet, moist, or dry based on predefined thresholds.

#### Applications

- **Agriculture:** Monitor soil moisture to optimize irrigation and improve crop yield.
- **Gardening:** Ensure proper watering of plants by monitoring soil moisture levels.
- **Environmental Monitoring:** Use soil moisture sensors in environmental monitoring applications to assess soil conditions.

#### Notes

- Calibrate the soil moisture sensor if necessary to ensure accurate readings.
- Adjust the predefined moisture level thresholds in the code based on the specific requirements of your application.
- Consider integrating the soil moisture sensor with actuators to automate irrigation systems based on soil moisture levels.
